## Design Decisions

### Technologies
- React.js app for component based architecture and JSX syntax
- Typescript for static typing, easier detection of errors and improved code readability
- Vite for faster development servers and optimized build procedures
- Mantine used for styling

### Architecture and UI
- Components are divided into many subcomponents that each perform one specific function
- Most props declared closer to the root (variables and functions) then frequently passed between parent and child components to ensure synchronization of multiple components across the web page
- Commonly used props made into interfaces for modularity and scalability, ex: FilterOptions
  ```
  interface FilterOptions {
    gender: string, 
    showActiveOnly: boolean, 
    ageRange: [number, number], 
    startDate: Date, 
    endDate: Date
    searchText: string
  }
  ```
- All active filters and active sorting displayed as Mantine chips aligned horizontally for user experience, chips are clickable and doing so will deselect the filter or sort
- Components have different primary colours based on category (filtering = blue, sorting = green, status = cyan, table = grape, grid = pink)
- Built in Mantine styles used for almost all styling in app for component consistency
- Proper indentation for cleaner code readability and coding using multiple side tabs

#### For a surprise, try making sure no one in the dataset fits your filters ü§™
